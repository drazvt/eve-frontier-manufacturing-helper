New File Structure:
📁 /src/data/ - Data Files
blueprints.ts: Contains all blueprint data with proper TypeScript interfaces
printerTypes.ts: Printer type configurations and logic to create printer types from blueprints
asteroidMining.ts: Asteroid type mapping for raw materials
📁 /src/types/ - Type Definitions
index.ts: Centralized TypeScript interfaces for Blueprint, PrinterType, and MineralTotal
Key Improvements:
🔧 Modular Architecture:
Separated Concerns: Data, types, and logic are now in separate files
Easy Maintenance: When real data comes in, you only need to update the data files
Type Safety: All interfaces are properly defined and imported
Scalable: Easy to add new blueprints, printer types, or asteroid mappings
🚀 Dynamic Data Loading:
createPrinterTypes(): Function that dynamically creates printer types from blueprint data
Flexible Imports: All data is imported as variables, making it easy to swap with API calls later
Clean Dependencies: Clear separation between data and UI logic
📊 Benefits for Real Data Integration:
Easy API Integration: Replace imports with API calls in the same files
Consistent Interfaces: TypeScript ensures data structure consistency
Centralized Updates: Change data in one place, updates everywhere
Testing Ready: Mock data can be easily swapped for test data
Performance: Data can be lazy-loaded or cached as needed
Next Steps for Real Data:
When you're ready to integrate real data, you can:

Replace blueprints.ts with an API call or database query
Update asteroidMining.ts with real asteroid-to-material mappings
Modify printerTypes.ts if printer configurations come from a different source
Add loading states and error handling in the main App component
The application now has a clean, maintainable structure that's ready for production data! 🎯
